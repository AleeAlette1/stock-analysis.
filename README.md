# Stock Analysis Using Excel VBA

## Overview of Project
The data provided is divided into two worksheets, 2017 and 2018, that contain stock information about 12 different stocks according to each year. Each worksheet outlines the stocks important information such as its ticker, issue date, the highest and lowest price of the stock, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price as well as the volume of the stock. The purpose of this project is to determine which stocks, if any are worth investing by refactoring our original script using VBA code in Microsoft Excel. The purpose of refactoring is to increase efficiency. 

## Results
Refactoring the code was necessary to create a code that is much more organized and easier to read as well as increasing time efficiency. By refactoring my script, I was able to decrease the macro run time. In the original script, it took about 0.496 seconds to run 2017 data and about 0.484 seconds to run 2018 data. After refactoring my script, it now takes about 0.195 seconds to run 2017 data and about 0.218 seconds to run 2018 data. When comparing the performance of stocks between 2017 and 2018 it is evident that the return of each stock is much higher in 2017 than 2018. Almost all stocks went from positive returns in 2017 to negative returns in 2018 except for the following: ticker 'TERP' remained a negative return, ticker 'ENPH' went from a positive return of 129.5% to 81.9%, but still remains positive. Finally, ticker 'RUN' was the only ticker that saw an return increase from 5.5% to 84.0%. 

## Summary
### Advantages of refactoring code
Refactoring code allows for your code to be better organized and clearer/easier to read for someone who will look at your project in the future. Furthermore, refactoring your code can improve your design and software to induce faster programming or debugging. 

### Disadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring code is great advantages; however it also has its disadvantages. Although an advantage of refactoring code makes your code more organized and clearer to read, it does not make your code any more functional because the behavior remains the same. Opposite to the advantages of debugging, refactoring code can potentially induce bugs that aren't caught. 

### Pros and Cons Applied to Refactoring the Original VBA Script
The number one pro that applied to my refactored script was the faster programming time. As mentioned in the original script, it took about 0.496 seconds to run 2017 data and about 0.484 seconds to run 2018 data. After refactoring my script, it now takes about 0.195 seconds to run 2017 data and about 0.218 seconds to run 2018 data. Attached below, you will find a screenshot of the run times for the new script for each year. In second place, refactoring my code did create a more organized and clearer script. I did not see any cons applied to my refactored code which I think it's due to the outline of the refactored code being provided.
